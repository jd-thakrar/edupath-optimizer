# 🎬 EduPath Optimizer - 3 Minute Video Script

## 🎯 Target Length: 3 minutes (180 seconds)

---

## 📋 SCENE BREAKDOWN

### **SCENE 1: HOOK & PROBLEM (0:00 - 0:30) - 30 seconds**

**[Visual: Show statistics/dashboard with concerning numbers]**

**Narration:**
> "Every year, thousands of students fail courses not because they lack ability, but because risks aren't identified early enough. Traditional academic systems are reactive - they intervene only after students have already failed."

**[Visual: Transition to EduPath Optimizer logo/landing page]**

> "What if AI could predict academic risk before it becomes a problem? Meet EduPath Optimizer - an AI-powered early warning system that predicts student failure with 96% accuracy and provides personalized interventions."

---

### **SCENE 2: THE SOLUTION (0:30 - 1:00) - 30 seconds**

**[Visual: Show architecture diagram or system flow]**

**Narration:**
> "EduPath Optimizer combines four powerful AI technologies:"

**[Visual: Show each component as mentioned]**

> "One - A Gradient Boosting machine learning model trained on attendance patterns, performance trends, and engagement metrics.

> Two - Explainable AI using Google's Gemini API that translates complex predictions into plain English.

> Three - A knowledge graph that maps course prerequisites and propagates risk across the curriculum.

> And four - A counterfactual engine that simulates 'what-if' scenarios to recommend the most effective interventions."

---

### **SCENE 3: LIVE DEMO - Student View (1:00 - 2:00) - 60 seconds**

**[Visual: Open the deployed live link - login page]**

**Narration:**
> "Let me show you how it works. Students log in using Firebase authentication with email or Google Sign-In."

**[Visual: Login and navigate to dashboard]**

> "The dashboard immediately shows their risk assessment. Here we see Alex Johnson has a 38% failure probability - that's medium risk."

**[Visual: Highlight key sections]**

> "The AI explains WHY: declining attendance, performance volatility in Data Structures, and engagement metrics below threshold. These aren't just numbers - they're actionable insights."

**[Visual: Show charts]**

> "Real-time charts visualize attendance trends and performance across subjects. Notice how the system tracks temporal patterns over 12 weeks."

**[Visual: Navigate to AI Insights page]**

> "Here's where it gets powerful. Click AI Insights..."

**[Visual: Show interventions]**

> "The system recommends three evidence-based interventions ranked by effectiveness. 'Improve Attendance to 90%+' reduces risk by 12% with moderate effort. Each intervention shows expected outcomes and AI-generated explanations."

**[Visual: Show simulation playground]**

> "Students can even simulate scenarios: 'What if I improve my test scores by 5 marks?' The system recalculates risk in real-time."

**[Visual: Highlight data consistency]**

> "Notice the same student ID appears across pages - that's our data consistency feature ensuring coherent analysis."

---

### **SCENE 4: ADMIN VIEW (2:00 - 2:30) - 30 seconds**

**[Visual: Navigate to admin dashboard]**

**Narration:**
> "For administrators, the admin dashboard provides system-wide oversight. We see 100 students analyzed with 20% at high risk."

**[Visual: Show risk distribution chart]**

> "Visual analytics break down risk distribution. The high-risk student table prioritizes intervention targets - Brandon White at 98% failure probability needs immediate attention."

**[Visual: Show knowledge graph or advanced features]**

> "Behind the scenes, the knowledge graph identifies that struggling in Database Systems puts students at 45% risk in Advanced Algorithms next semester - enabling proactive curriculum planning."

---

### **SCENE 5: TECHNICAL HIGHLIGHTS & CALL TO ACTION (2:30 - 3:00) - 30 seconds**

**[Visual: Show architecture or code snippets briefly]**

**Narration:**
> "The tech stack: Flask backend with 15+ REST APIs, Firebase Firestore for real-time data, and Chart.js for interactive visualizations. The ML model achieves 96% accuracy using 12 engineered temporal features."

**[Visual: Show the deployment/GitHub]**

> "Fully deployed on Render.com with complete CI/CD. The entire codebase - over 10,000 lines - is production-ready with comprehensive documentation."

**[Visual: Return to landing page or final dashboard view]**

> "EduPath Optimizer isn't just about predictions - it's about empowerment. By identifying risks early and providing clear, actionable interventions, we're transforming academic support from reactive to proactive. Because every student deserves a chance to succeed."
